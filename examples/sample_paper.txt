Title: Demo Paper on Long Document Summarization

Abstract:
This demo abstract describes a two-phase summarization approach used for long scientific documents. The pipeline segments the document and summarizes sections.

Introduction:
Long scientific documents require careful handling to preserve technical terms and important results. This demo shows segmentation and section-level summarization.

Methods:
We use simple segmentation, extract key phrases, compute embeddings and demonstrate a contrastive loss on toy data. We then allocate summary budget per section.

Results:
The demo produces short summaries per section and concatenates them into a final summary.

Discussion:
This sample file is intentionally short to keep the demo fast.
